# Detect Auth Client-Side in Next.js with TypeScript

This example shows how to detect a user's authenticated state client-side
when using an HttpOnly cookie. This architecture supports both SSR (server-side rendering)
and static optimization and is explained in this [blog post](https://dev.to/justincy/detecting-a-user-s-authenticated-state-client-side-in-next-js-using-an-httponly-cookie-and-static-optimization-6ib).
This example is also available [without TypeScript](../static).
