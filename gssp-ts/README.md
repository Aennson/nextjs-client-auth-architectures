# Using `getServerSideProps` to Detect Auth Server-Side, with TypeScript

This example shows how to verify a user's authenticated state
server-side with `getServerSideProps`. Static optimization is not supported
with this architecture. If you need to support static optimization
then you should use the variation of this which [detects auth client-side](../static-ts).
This architecture is explained in this [blog post](TODO).
This example is also available [without TypeScript](../gssp).
